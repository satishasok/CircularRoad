There are n gas stations positioned along a circular road. 
Each has a limited supply of gas. 
You can only drive clockwise around the road. 
You start with zero gas. 
Knowing how much gas you need to get from each gas station to the next and 
how much gas you can get at each station, 
design an algorithm to find the gas station you need to start at to get all the way around the circle.
